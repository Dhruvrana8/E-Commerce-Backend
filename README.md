## **API Best Practices**

1. Use **HTTP methods** to indicate action (`GET`, `POST`, `PUT/PATCH`, `DELETE`).
2. API URLs are **resource-based**, not action-based.
3. Implement **authentication & permissions** (JWT / Token / Session).
4. Use **pagination, filtering, and search** for product and order listings.
5. Standardize **response structure**:

```json
{
    "success": true,
    "data": {},
    "message": "Operation completed successfully."
}
